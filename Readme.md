<h2>CAC-2 : Implementing K-Means on a Dataset<br/>

<h5>About the Dataset</h5><br/>
The 'Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand',contains 7050 observations and 16 attributes. The data is about live selling feature on the Facebook platform. Each record consists of information about the time live information of sale is posted to Facebook and engagements in the data. The engagements are regular Facebook interactions such as share and emotion rection.

<h5>K-Means Clustering</h5><br/> 
K-means clustering aims to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. Each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (also known as the cluster center or centroid), which serves as a prototype for that cluster.<br/>
Itâ€™s an iterative algorithm that divides an unlabeled dataset into K different clusters, ensuring that each data point belongs to only one group with similar properties.<br/>
K-means is particularly useful for discovering natural groupings within data without requiring any prior training or labeled examples, i.e unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
